## Inspiration
Inspired from :
Over the past year, we noticed that YouTube has become a central hub for learning amongst millions of students and our our goal was to optimize their learning. On, average a person spends more time searching for a video rather than watching one. YouTube is known for having a very dense database of content, making it harder to find quality content. To ensure students have an easier time with their education throughout such hard times inspired us to pursue a solution to this problem.

## What it does
Vid2Go is a **Google Chrome Extension**, which allows you to identify which YouTube videos are quality-enriched, by providing time-stamps to selective/important segments. With the input of 1 keyword, users can take advantage of **Vid2Go**, which our software checks YouTube's API for the captions file, and reveals 5 - Time Stamps for the user. Providing important segments related to the keyword, Vid2Go allows students to spend more time studying on quality content.

## How we built it
We built an express server that uses YouTube's caption API to get the  video's transcript. The chrome extension uses the express API endpoints to search words that are entered by the user. The timestamps are then displayed to the user.

## Challenges we ran into
The key challenges we faced when brainstorming and subsequently building Vid2Go were time constraints and compatibility. As most of our team was new to hackathons, even having TreeHacks as our first, it was difficult to adjust to creating a larger scale project with new technology in addition to working in a remote environment. As a result, we tried a few ideas during the hacking time which unfortunately did not work out and ended up having to pivot our idea to Vid2Go which we are extremely proud of. Had we had more time, more features could have been added to the chrome extension. Furthermore, we struggled with compatibility and combining all the languages and tools each member used into one seamless product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some of the key accomplishments that we are proud to have achieved include creating a useful chrome extension for YouTube videos, working with and further developing our understanding of API’s and working together seamlessly in an online environment. When coming into TreeHacks we struggled with ideas for a project but knew that we wanted it to have an impact and be of use and thus Vid2Go was developed. We are all university students and often use YouTube as an additional source for study material. However, we often struggle to find the information we need and thus by using Vid2Go as an application we are able to skip to the portions of the video that contain the information that we need. Furthermore, we are proud that we were able to work with the YouTube video’s API in order to extract the required information for our application. Finally, we are proud that we were able to work together in a positive manner entirely online.

## What we learned
Some of the key takeaways from this Hackathon and Vid2Go include working collaboratively in a remote environment and working with new technologies. As a result of Covid-19, all activities have moved online, nonetheless, it is still a challenge to work together online, more so when it is with new people and in a time constrained environment such as a Hackathon. We are proud that we worked well together and that we were all able to further develop our skills in terms of communication and collaboration. Furthermore, we all worked with new technologies be it regular expressions, new python libraries or chrome extensions, we were all able to add a new skill to our toolbox that we will take to further projects and competitions.

## What's next for Vid2Go
Vid2Go due to time constraints was limited to YouTube, but its capabilities are boundless. By parsing data and deeming whether its important can be useful in many media industries, ranging from Podcasts, Video-Recorded lectures, to  Webinars and more.
